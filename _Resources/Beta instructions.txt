Calibre/Marvin device driver plugin beta testing

General requirements:
 • Calibre 0.9.33 or later, running under Linux, OS X or Windows
 • An iPad eligible to receive TestFlight updates of Marvin
 • Marvin with calibre connector feature
 • The latest calibre/Marvin device driver

Initial setup:
 • If you installed the 'Apple iDevice interface' device driver plugin (v0.0.6), remove it. This driver replaces that plugin.
 • If you installed the 'Annotations' plugin (v1.1.2), remove it. There is an updated version of the Annotations plugin, which will be made available soon.
 • If you are running calibre in the Windows or OS X environment, you need to have iTunes installed. The driver doesn't use iTunes, but it depends on some software libraries and services installed with iTunes.
 • After installing the driver for the first time, you need to configure it. With your iDevice disconnected, go to Preferences|Advanced|Plugins|Device Interface plugins, scroll to 'iOS reader applications' and select it.
 • Click 'Customize plugin'.
 • Preferred iOS reader application: Marvin.
 • Debug options: Enable debugging for iDevices should be checked.
 • Click on the 'Marvin Options' tab, then the '?' icon for help describing the options. There are also tool tips available when hovering the mouse pointer over the Marvin Options sections.

Downloading the latest version of the driver:
 • Download the latest version of the driver from this Dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dj2zv500m5i6a8/Apple%20reader%20applications.zip. This link will stay constant as the version number increases. I will announce updates to the driver in this thread. The initial version number is 0.1.12.
 • Install the latest version of the driver from the Plugins section of calibre Preferences, or you can install from the command line (assuming you're in the same directory as the downloaded driver):
    calibre-customize -a "iOS reader applications.zip"
 • Options are retained when updating the driver.

Providing debug information:
 • If you're experiencing a problem, I will need to see a debug trace.
 • Open a terminal window, then type
    calibre-debug -g > debug.txt
 • Repeat the steps necessary to cause the problem, then close calibre.
 • Attach the debug log to a post along with a description of the steps you took causing the problem.

Uninstalling the plugin and its resources:
 • Go to Preferences|Advanced|Plugins|Device Interface plugins, scroll to 'iOS reader applications' and select it.
 • Click 'Remove plugin'
 • Click 'Apply'
 • Go to Preferences|Advanced|Miscellaneous, click 'Open calibre configuration directory'
 • Open the 'plugins' folder
 • Delete 'iOS reader applications.json' and the folder 'iOS_reader_applications_resources'
 • Restart calibre
